# supply-chain-optimization-with-neptune
This project aims to optimize supply chain operations using Amazon Neptune, a graph database service. It models suppliers, products, warehouses, and their relationships as a graph to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.

## Problem Statement
Managing a complex supply chain involves multiple suppliers, products, warehouses, and distribution channels. Traditional databases struggle to handle the interconnected nature of these entities and the dynamic nature of supply and demand.

## Solution
Utilize Amazon Neptune to create a scalable graph database solution for supply chain optimization. The project includes:

Schema Definition: Define vertices (suppliers, products, warehouses) and edges (relationships like supplies, stored_in) using Gremlin.

Data Loading: Load sample data into Neptune to simulate a supply chain network.

Algorithm Implementation: Implement graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path, clustering) to optimize supply chain operations.

Visualization: Visualize supply chain data using Jupyter notebooks with D3.js or similar libraries.

Deployment: Guide for deploying the solution on AWS Neptune and configuring necessary settings.
